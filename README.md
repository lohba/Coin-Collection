Collect as many coins before time runs out. You can purchase items using some Ether that will increase your coin collecting abilities. 

To get started:

1. Run the game on the test network by going to the erc-1155 folder and running
```bash
 truffle migrate --network ropsten --reset
```
2. Run a local python server by going to index.js and running
```bash
python -m http.server
```


Once coins are collected, the ERC-20 token should show up in your MetaMask
